== Installation ==

1. Install Security Safe automatically or by uploading the ZIP file to your plugins folder. 
2. Activate the Security Safe on the 'Plugins' admin page. The plugin initially sets minimum security policies active.
3. Navigate to the General Settings by clicking on the Security Safe menu located on the left side admin panel.
4. On General Settings, You will notice the main icon menu at the top of the page. Navigate through all of them and change settings as they pertain to your site's needs.

If you notice that your site is not functioning as expected, you can turn off each type of security policy (Privacy, Files, User Access, etc.) by navigating to each page and disabling the policy type. If necessary, you can disable all policy types at once using General Settings.
